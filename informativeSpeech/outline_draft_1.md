> #### Specific Purpose: To inform my audience about the Golden Ratio, a mathematical connection between science, arts and design.

## Central Idea Statement: the Golden Ratio has been used since 490bc as a means to guide the work and balance the designs of mankind from the Parthenon to the modern day discovery of quasicrystals.

## Organizational Technique: Topical

1. INTRODUCTION
    
    Attention Getting Device - Will someone please pick a number between one and ten? (ask for a member of the audience to participate) Alright, that's a good number.  Lets take the number one, and divide it by your number [audience's number] to get a quotient of... [read quotient from calculator].  Now by adding one to that number we can use it as a *new* dividend in *another repition* of the same math problem.  One divided by [our new number]... add one... repeat...  By repeat this process keeping 1 as our divisor and updating the dividen by adding 1 to the quotient of our previous calculation the Golden Ratio will emerge, like magic, on your calulator at the front most part of the number.  The greatest thing about this process is that, it only takes about 8 or 9 repeats of this simple math problem to get an accurate enough version of the Golden Ratio for everyday use.  Continuing this process simply refines our calculation to become more and more precice - just like [pi] or any other irrational number.
