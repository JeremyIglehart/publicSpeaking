## Central Idea Statement: the Golden Ratio used since 300bc as a "mathimatical compass" to guide the work and designs of mankind from the Parthenon to the modern day discovery of quasicrystals.

## Organizational Technique: Topical

1. INTRODUCTION
    
    Attention Getting Device - Someone pick a number between 1 and 10 (wait for an audience member to participate) So, we'll take the number one, and divide it by [the audience's number] and then add one to that number.  Now we'll repeat this process by keeping 1 as our divisor and updating the dividen by adding 1 to the quotient of our previous calculation.  Repeating this process the Golden Ratio will emerge at the front end of your calculator.  Continuing this process will refine our calculation to become more precice - just like [pi] or any other irrational number.  The great thing about this is that only takes about 8 or 9 repeats of this simple math problem to get an accurate enough version of the Golden Ratio for day use.

    Preview/Central Idea Statement/ -- the Golden Ratio, about 1.618, has used since 300bc as a "mathimatical compass" to guide the work and designs of mankind from the Parthenon to the modern day discovery of quasicrystals.
