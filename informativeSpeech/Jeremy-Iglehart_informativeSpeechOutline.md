## Central Idea Statement: the Golden Ratio has been used throughout the ages as a mathicmatical axiom of balance and beauity influencing the design of ancient architecture, guiding us to scientific discoveries, and is still used every day in the art of typography.

## Organizational Technique: Topical

1. INTRODUCTION
    
    Attention Getting Device - Give me [a number between one and ten][I1] (wait for audience) Alright, [audiences number] is a good number.  (typing into a calculator) Lets take the number one, and divide it by [audience's number] to get a quotient of [read from calculator] and then add one to that number.  And divide again by taking one divided by our new number to get [read from calculator].  Okay, and then add one, and divide it again by our new number... and alright the good news is we only have to do this about 7 or 8 times to start to see what's happening here.  By repeating this process we will begin to see that the number 1.6 never leaves the front of the calculation, and then 1.61 and 1.618, 1.6180, three, three.  This number is known as the Golden Ratio, and this is a simple way to calculate it.  Or you could just take the square root of 5, add one and divide by two to get 1.618 - if you have a calculator, this is faster.
    
    Preview/Central Idea Statement/ -- the Golden Ratio, approximately 1.618, has been used throughout the ages as a mathicmatical axiom of balance and beauity influencing the design of ancient architecture, guiding us to scientific discoveries, and is still used every day in the art of typography.
    
    TRANSITION: Let's go back and talk about...
    
2. BODY (Main Points)
    
    A. An ancient greek sculptor by the name of Phidias.
        Support for A:

        Historians claim that Phidias, was so inspired by the golden ratio and employed it in his works so extensivly that the Greek symbol phi(φ) (named after phidias) eventually became the known as the symbol in mathimatics used to denote the Golden Ratio.  It was Phidias who was the architect who designed the [Parthenon][L1] - which is perhaps the most commonly refered to feet of architecture in relation to the Golden Ratio.
        
        TRANSITION: For more than 2000 years the Golden Ratio has mesmerized many of the worlds sharpest minds in philosophy, the arts, and the sciences.
        
    B. From a scientific perspective
        Support for B:

        The golden ratio seems to be more clearly important in it's application in the arts, and to artists.  Because both the way it has been employed and how we are able to detect it after the fact are extremely subtle acts.  In order to make use of the golden ratio, or even sense it's presence in some design properly, one must take [great analytical care][L2].

        From Fibonacci, to [quasicrystals][L3], to sunflowers the Golden Ratio may be found in an extraordinarily vast amount of discaplines.
        
        TRANSITION: So, now that you know how simple it is to calculate, and that we've been using it for thousands of years in more than thousands of ways...  Let's talk about a few things in your every day life where the Golden Ratio though subtle, has been there this whole time.
        
    C. Typography is the art of orchestrating the symphony of text
        Support for C:

        There is a symphony happening right in front of your eyes.  You "hear" it every time you see a billboard, read a book, magazine, or blog.

        Typography is the perfect marriage of form and function, and when done right - the words "sing" right off the page effortlessly into your mind through your eyes.

        A typographer may skillfully use the Golden Ratio to calculate the optimal amount of proportioning from one letter, or word to another in order to tell the eye exactly where to go to find the good stuff.
        
        TRANSITION: If you have you ever struggled to find the next line when reading in a book or website, listen up - because this the most interesting part for you.
        
3. CONCLUSION
        
        Summary – All you need to do is [remember is three simple things][I2]: font-size, line-height, line-width.

        Take the font-size and multiply it by the Golden Ratio, that's how you find the optimal line-height (easy right?) now just square the line-height, and take that as your line-width, and you're good to go.
        
        Concluding Device -- As it turns out, good design is more often than not like paint by numbers than the art of "reading the tea leaves".  What other goodies does the Golden Ratio have in store for you?  Thank you.
